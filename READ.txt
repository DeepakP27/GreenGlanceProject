 -Main Function (1): The user is met with a Sign-up/Login page that takes advantage of Google Firebase, Firestore, and Cloud to keep track of the user's information, including their username, password, location, type of device, number of scans, total kilograms of carbon emissions, etc. To promote user safety, there is also authentication processes inbuilt into the app.

   -Main Function (2): Scan your Trash. Using the user's camera or gallery, the user is able to input image of trash. The great thing about the app is that there can be more than one piece of trash in the image. The app stores the trash and feeds it into both our custom model as well as is aided by open ai's vision api. (Then Side Function). The app then provides information on the material of the trash in the image, and quantifies just how much trash there is in the image. On top of this, the app also provides information relating to the trash's recyclability to help promote more eco-friendly choices and ensure trash is going where it belongs. Finally, the app approximates the carbon emission in kilograms of each trash in the image, and gives a total as well; the reason that this feature was added so that the user is able to quantify the difference they are making by recycling and taking care of the environment.

- Side Function (2): To assist the Open AI API, and enhance accuracy, a custom model trained using SqueezeNet and data-preprocessing techniques such as augmentation and normalization, was used to determine the type of material (aluminum, celluloseacetate, glass, metal, paper, plastic, polystyrene, rubber, tetrapak, textile) the trash is made of given an image. The model took advantage of an open-source dataset on Kaggle.

- Main Function (3): In order to help users with their questions, the app also has a chat bot built into it. The chat bot is able to answer any questions the user may have relating to safe environmental practices.

- Main Function (4): Once the user scans the trash and is able to identify its material and the best recyclability practices, the app then takes it one step forward and gives the user access to the 3 closest recycling centers to their current location. The following information are provided for each center: name, address, phone number, open-time, and distance from the user's current location.

- Main Function (5): In order to provide incentive to users, specifically a younger audience, including teenagers and children, the app has challenges integrated into it. This section can be expanded on; as it stands, it contains challenges relating to the total number of scans the user has taken of trash, and automatically updates once they have reached the threshold necessary to complete the challenge. For example, if the user scans 200 times, they have completed three challenges: Scan Challenge Easy, Scan-athon Medium, and Eco Warrior Hard.
